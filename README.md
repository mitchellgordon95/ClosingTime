# ClosingTime
Analysis of operating hours in the top 20 cities of the united states based on data from Yelp. Also includes minimum wage data by municipality and state for possible correlative analysis.

For summary of results, see charts in generated_images.

## Future Work
Given these results, I'd like to investigate any correlative parameters of the cities. For example, minimum wage or city drinking laws. 
Minimum wage is provided by state and municipality in VZ_state_annual and VZ_substate_annual.
